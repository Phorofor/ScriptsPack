# Scripts Pack

This is Scripts Pack with the intention of being able to run scripts that tweak certain values in preferences files that normally cannot done through System Preferences. It primarily utilizes 'do shell script' in AppleScript to perform simple shell commands. Its primary purpose was to allow users to tweak their settings while being under some sort of restrictions from a school (such as Parental Controls) that would be applied and would usually prevent them from running apps that are not approved by their organisation's policies while still allowing default apps such as the AppleScript Editor to be used.
