# Scripts Pack Changes

20120717 (v0.0.01):
Scripts Pack has arrived. Preferences checkers, version checkers and some more! All purely script-based. All open-source. No applications. No need to execute any binary when opening these scripts. Expect bugs or mistakes and lack of all of the hidden features because it's a bit of a pain to work with some of these scripts and building them.

- Initial Test Release

Features need to be added/improved:

- Make it easier and quicker to access
- List mode to be able to view scripts in one single applescript (probably won't happen)
- Add a window title with custom icons with the 'display alert' function (might not be possible)
