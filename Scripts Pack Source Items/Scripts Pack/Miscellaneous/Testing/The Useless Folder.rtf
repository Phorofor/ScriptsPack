\f2\i0\fs24 \cf0 Welcome to the useless folder! Scripts that are stored here are either still being developed or are not fully tested. Test them if you like, but remember that you should take precautions when running scripts at any time. I might place some scripts here so you can take a peek of some stuff that's going to be included but I may not show everything that's still in development, only some.\
